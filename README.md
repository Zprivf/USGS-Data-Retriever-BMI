BMI USGS Streamflow Data Retriever
This repository provides a Basic Model Interface (BMI) implementation for retrieving daily streamflow data from the USGS National Water Information System (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis).

Features:
Retrieves daily streamflow data for any specified station and date range.
Compatible with any BMI-wrapped model for seamless integration into existing modeling workflows.
Standardized interface for easy adoption and use.

Benefits:
Simplifies access to USGS streamflow data within your modeling frameworks.
Promotes interoperability between models and data sources.
Reduces development time by leveraging the established BMI standard.
Getting Started:

Install: Follow the installation instructions provided in the README.md file.
Configure: Specify the desired USGS station ID and date range in your model's configuration.
Run: The BMI retrieves the requested data and makes it available to your model.
